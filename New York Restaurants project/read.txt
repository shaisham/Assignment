

Let’s begin!




1.
Start by getting a feel for the nomnom table:





2.
What are the distinct neighborhoods?



3.
What are the distinct cuisine types?


4.
Suppose we would like some Chinese takeout.



5.
Return all the restaurants with reviews of 4 and above.


6.
Suppose Abbi and Ilana want to have a fancy dinner date.

Return all the restaurants that are Italian and $$$.


7.
Your coworker Trey can’t remember the exact name of a restaurant he went to but he knows it contains the word ‘meatball’ in it.





8.
Let’s order delivery to the house!

Find all the close by spots in Midtown, Downtown or Chinatown.




9.
Find all the health grade pending restaurants (empty values).


10.
Create a Top 10 Restaurants Ranking based on reviews.


11.
Use a CASE statement to change the rating system to:

review > 4.5 is Extraordinary
review > 4 is Excellent
review > 3 is Good
review > 2 is Fair
Everything else is Poor
Don’t forget to rename the new column!
